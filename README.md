# Introduction
This is Arisu, an IRC bot created by Carlgo11 using PircBot designed in Java.
This project is hardcoded. There for you will not be able to just startup the bot without any modifications.

**Read the LICENSE file before working with this project!**

# What does Arisu do?
## Can it execute static messages?
Yes it can. More information will come about how to set channel commands.

## Can it log chat?
No, I do not approve channel logging. I see it as a threat against personal privacy.
There for I have not, and will never, make a logging script. 

Arisu does log commands in channels but that's only because of security purposes and are not public.
I personally delete all my command-logs every Sunday at 0:00.

## How can I contribute?
If you know how to program in Java you can contribute to this project. If approved, your script will be public under our licenses. Note that we do not take credit for your contributions!

## I want this in my channel!
Arisu is currently running on irc.esper.net & irc.kamino.in. If your channel is not on one of these servers mail me at carlgo11@carlgo11.com and I can setup Arisu on your server.

If your channel is on one of these servers do /invite Arisu and the bot will join your channel.

## I want to use parts of your code in my project
Please mail me at carlgo11@carlgo11 before you implement any of the code from this project into your own project.
I will in most cases approve usage of my code but I want to know where it's used.
You also have to give credit for the code to me. For more information see the LICENSE file.
